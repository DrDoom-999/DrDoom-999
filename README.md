🖖 Hello World!

🙃    I’m @DrDoom-999 and a beginner to Git / GitHub and to Java-Development.
💻    To expand my knowledge and get an idea of how Git works, I made this account. 
🧑‍🤝‍🧑    Moreover, I would like to share my programs with others and contribute to OpenSource.
👣    If you have ideas for my projects or discovered an issue, you're welcome to make a pull request!
